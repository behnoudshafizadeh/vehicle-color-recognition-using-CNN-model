# vehicle-color-recognition-using-CNN-model

## discription
> in this project,we have used CNN architecture for detecting vehicle color,the colors are used in this project :

> Beige,Black,Blue,Brown,Gray,Green,Orange,Red,Silver,White,Yellow.

> Hint:dataset and training files are not available,Until the paper related this project will be published.Meanwhile you are able to use test models for predicting vehicle color by using model weight `color_model.h5` and prediction code in google colab `color_prediction.ipynb`. 

> building an input file `input` containing images.

## road map for testing code

> first-step : mount your google colab dirve by using below instructions:
>
```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive/')
import os
os.chdir("/content/drive/MyDrive/train python/IMAGE-AI")
!ls
```
> seconde-step : install requrements in google colab
